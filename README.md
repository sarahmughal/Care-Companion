## Inspiration
Seeing some of our closest peers suffer from mental illnesses, we discovered that mental health, mental illnesses, and the stigma around them are an apparent issue in society today. By creating this app, we want people to be open to getting help who may not personally seek it out themselves as they may not be aware of the illness, or are suppressing it because of the constant social pressure and stigma around the illnesses we face in society today. We want to make a change in some of the most apparent issues in our community, and mental health is the one we feel most passionate about.
